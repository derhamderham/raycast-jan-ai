## Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **Jan.ai** running locally with API server enabled
2. **Apple Reminders** app (for reminder creation)
3. **Python 3** with the following packages:
   ```bash
   pip3 install pdfplumber pytesseract Pillow
   ```

### Optional: PDF OCR Support

For OCR processing of image-based PDFs (invoices, scanned documents):

1. **Tesseract OCR** - Install via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install tesseract
   ```

2. **Poppler** (for pdftoppm utility) - Install via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install poppler
   ```

**Note:** PDF text extraction will work without OCR for text-based PDFs using pdfplumber. OCR is only needed for scanned/image-based PDFs.

## How Reminders Work

1. Text is sent to Jan.ai for structured extraction
2. Jan.ai returns JSON with:
   - Title
   - Amount (if applicable)
   - Due date
   - Recurrence pattern
   - Bill/Invoice classification
3. Extension creates reminder in Apple Reminders with:
   - Task title
   - Amount in notes (formatted as "$150.00")
   - Due date
   - [BILL] or [INVOICE] tag
   - Recurrence information

## Supported Date Formats

- **Relative**: "tomorrow", "next week", "in 3 days"
- **Absolute**: "Jan 15", "January 15th", "2025-01-15"
- **Day names**: "Monday", "next Friday"

## Supported Repeat Intervals

- `daily`
- `weekly`
- `monthly`
- `yearly`

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to Jan.ai"
- Ensure Jan.ai is running
- Enable API server in Jan.ai settings
- Verify API URL in preferences

### "Missing authorization header"
- Set your Jan.ai API key in preferences
- Verify the key is correct

### Model errors
- Check installed models in Jan.ai
- Use exact model ID (case-sensitive)
- Verify model is downloaded and active

### Reminder creation fails
- Ensure "To Do" list exists in Apple Reminders
- Extension will create list if missing
- Check Reminders app permissions

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run fix-lint
```

## Tips

1. **Better date parsing**: Be specific - "Jan 15" works better than "next month"
2. **Amount extraction**: Include currency symbols - "$150" or "€50"
3. **Categorization**: Use keywords like "bill", "invoice", "recurring" for better results
4. **Model selection**: Larger models give better extraction but are slower

## Getting Your Model Name

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Common model IDs:
- `llama-3.1-8b-instruct`
- `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2`
- `phi-2`
